# Classkick Automatic Uploader

This Python script automates the tedious process of uploading images to a multi-page Classkick assignment. It logs into your Classkick account, navigates to the specified assignment, and uploads a series of images from a local folder to the corresponding slides.

The script uses a combination of **Selenium** for browser automation and **PyAutoGUI** to handle the native OS file upload dialog, which cannot be controlled by Selenium directly.

<br>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

This script will take **full control of your mouse and keyboard** during its operation to handle the file upload dialog.

> **DO NOT touch your mouse or keyboard while the script is running.**

You will be given a 4-second countdown before it begins.

<br>

## Features

-   ‚úÖ Automatically logs into your Classkick account.
-   ‚úÖ Navigates directly to the assignment link you provide.
-   ‚úÖ Finds all images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) in a specified folder.
-   ‚úÖ Uploads images sequentially to the corresponding slides (e.g., `01.png` -> Slide 1, `02.png` -> Slide 2).
-   ‚úÖ Uses robust JavaScript clicks to bypass potential UI overlays that can block interaction.
-   ‚úÖ Provides real-time progress updates in the console.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  **Google Chrome:** The script is written for Chrome. [Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
3.  **ChromeDriver:** The version of ChromeDriver **must** match your version of Google Chrome.
    -   [Download ChromeDriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/)
    -   After downloading, make sure the `chromedriver` executable is in your system's PATH. (Or place it in the same directory as the script).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    Or simply download the Python script to a new folder on your computer.

2.  **Install Required Python Libraries:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    selenium
    pyautogui
    ```
    Then, install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Alternatively, install them one by one:
    ```bash
    pip install selenium pyautogui
    ```

3.  **Prepare Your Images:**
    -   Create a folder named `homework_images` in the same directory as the script.
    -   Place all your assignment images inside this folder.
    -   **Crucially, name your files so they sort alphabetically in the correct order.** The script uploads them in this sorted order. A good naming convention is:
        -   `01_page.png`
        -   `02_page.png`
        -   `03_page.png`
        -   ...
        -   `10_page.png`

4.  **Configure the Script:**
    Open the script file (e.g., `upload_to_classkick.py`) in a text editor and fill in your details in the `CONFIG` section at the top of the file:

    ```python
    # ===============================================================
    # ===============  CONFIG: PLEASE EDIT THESE!  ==================
    # ===============================================================
    CLASSKICK_URL = "https://app.classkick.com/#/assignments/..."  # <--- PASTE YOUR ASSIGNMENT LINK HERE
    CLASSKICK_USERNAME = "your_email@example.com"                # <--- PUT YOUR USERNAME/EMAIL HERE
    CLASSKICK_PASSWORD = "your_secret_password"                  # <--- PUT YOUR PASSWORD HERE
    IMAGE_FOLDER = "homework_images"                             # Default is 'homework_images'
    # ===============================================================
    ```

<br>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Make sure you have completed all the steps in the **Installation & Setup** section.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
4.  Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python upload_to_classkick.py
    ```
5.  The script will print a warning and start after a short delay. **Do not interfere with your computer until the script prints that it is finished.**

## üíª OS Compatibility Note

This script uses `pyautogui.hotkey('command', 'shift', 'g')` to open the "Go to Folder" dialog. **This is a macOS-specific shortcut.**

-   **On macOS:** The script should work as is.
-   **On Windows/Linux:** You will need to modify the `pyautogui` section of the code to work with your operating system's file dialog. A common approach for Windows is to directly type the full file path into the file name input box.

    **Potential modification for Windows/Linux:**
    Replace this block:
    ```python
    print("Selecting file with PyAutoGUI...")
    time.sleep(2)
    pyautogui.hotkey('command', 'shift', 'g')
    time.sleep(1)
    pyautogui.write(os.path.dirname(absolute_image_path))
    pyautogui.press('enter')
    time.sleep(1)
    pyautogui.write(os.path.basename(absolute_image_path))
    pyautogui.press('enter')
    ```
    With something like this, which types the full path directly:
    ```python
    print("Selecting file with PyAutoGUI...")
    time.sleep(2)
    # For Windows/Linux, you can often just type the full path
    pyautogui.write(absolute_image_path)
    time.sleep(1)
    pyautogui.press('enter')
    ```
